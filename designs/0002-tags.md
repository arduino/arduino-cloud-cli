# Introduction of tags for device and thing

## Review Period

Best before October, 18 2021.

## What is the problem?
We need to design the commands to **handle tags** for things and devices. Tags could be attached and detached to/from any thing or device. Also, certain commands could take tags as input in order to perform operations on multiple things/devices.

## Out-of-Scope

## User Experience Walkthrough


## Implementation

### Project Changes

Commands that could regard multiple things or devices could be changed in order to accept tags.

These commands can be:

**list commands**:

`thing list --tags <key0>=<value0>,<key1>=<value1>` to list all the things having all the tags passed

`device list --tags <key0>=<value0>,<key1>=<value1>` to list all the devices having all the tags passed


**delete commands**:

`thing delete --tags <key0>=<value0>,<key1>=<value1>` to delete all the things having all the tags passed

`device delete --tags <key0>=<value0>,<key1>=<value1>` to delete all the devices having all the tags passed


**ota command**:

`ota upload --device-tags <key0>=<value0>,<key1>=<value1> --file <sketch-file.ino.bin>` to perform an upload via ota to all the devices having all the tags passed


**flags constraints**:
In delete and ota commands, the `--id` flag should become **optional** instead of mandatory. 
Then, if neither `--id` nor `--tags` is passed, the command should return an error telling the user to specify at least one of the two flags.
On the other hand, if both flags are passed, the command should return an error telling to choose only one of the two flags.

**error handling**:
When a command performs actions on multiple resources, its execution will stop as soon as an error is encountered. 

### Breaking Change

The changes listed above should not break anything, the commands could be used as before.

### Design

New commands should be introduced in order to add and delete tags to devices and things. Here are some alternatives:

Implementing a tag command:
`arduino-cloud-cli tag create --thing <thingID> --tags <key0>=<value0>,<key1>=<value1>`

Adding a tag subcommand in device and thing commands:
`arduino-cloud-cli thing create-tags --thing <thingID> --tags <key0>=<value0>,<key1>=<value1>` and same for device


### Documentation Changes

Readme should be updated
